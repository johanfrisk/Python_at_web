# Some bits and bobs for scraping <BR> plus some BDD

## Web scraping
My collection of resources for connecting Python to the web. Also my notes from University of Michiganâ€™s MOOC on scraping.

## Behavior driven testing
Trying out 'Behave' with 'Gherkin' as frameworks for specification and testing
of Python code.

## Bucket list
The things I want to accomplish around scraping:

- [x] MOOC on webscraping with Python
++ [x] HTML with Beautiful Soup
++ [x] XML with lxml and etree
++ [x] JSON with json
++ [x] Regex with RE
++ [x] HTML more in depth following video tutorial
- [ ] Getting a script working scraping financial figures
- [ ] Getting Behave into a natural part of my workflow
